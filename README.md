# Gale Shapely Algo:

- Group A (Proposers) - They want to propose
- Group B (Acceptors) - They want to accept or reject the proposal

Each person in Group A has list of preffered partners in Group B, and vice versa. 
- Goal : To form stable pairs, where no one in pair would prefer someone else over their current partners.

### Possible Problems in the algorithm:

- Someone in Group A prefers someone in Group B more than their current partner.
- Someone in Group B prefers someone in Group A more than their current partner.

### How Gale Shapely comes into action

- All people are matched
- No one wants to "break up" their pair for someone else
